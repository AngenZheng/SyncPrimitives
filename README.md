# syncprimitives

The code includes a subset of synchronization primitives I wroted using atomic instructions (e.g., lock add, lock cmpxchg) provided modern CPUs, while I was taking the Operating System course. The primitives implemented inlcude: 

* Memory barriers 
* Atomic operations 
* Barriers 
* Spinlocks 
* Reader-Writer Locks 
* A lock freequeue
